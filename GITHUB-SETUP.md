# GitHub Repository Setup for ForexJoey

Follow these steps to create a GitHub repository for ForexJoey and push your code.

## 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter repository details:
   - Name: `forexjoey` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: "AI-first forex autonomous agent with multi-intelligence sources"
   - Visibility: Choose either Public or Private
   - Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
4. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show instructions. Use the "push an existing repository" option.

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/qb10x/New-forex-joey
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/forexjoey.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## 3. Verify the Repository

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your ForexJoey files and directories
3. The README.md will be displayed on the main page

## 4. Set Up Branch Protection (Optional but Recommended)

For better code quality and collaboration:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" > "Branches"
3. Under "Branch protection rules", click "Add rule"
4. Enter "main" as the branch name pattern
5. Check options like "Require pull request reviews before merging"
6. Click "Create"

## Next Steps

Once your code is on GitHub, you can:

1. Continue with the Render deployment using the instructions in `docs/RENDER-DEPLOYMENT.md`
2. Share the repository with collaborators if needed
3. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD (optional)

Remember that your environment variables and sensitive API keys are excluded from the repository thanks to the .gitignore file. You'll need to set these up separately in Render.
